# Guess the Number Game 
## About
This is a simple "Guess the Number" game made with Python and Tkinter.  
You try to guess a number between 1 and 100.  
The game shows if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.  
It also keeps track of how many games you played, wins, and losses.
## Learning
This project was planned as a group project, but I mostly did the coding myself.  
We were learning different parts of the project and explaining them to each other.  
I practiced:
- Python programming
- Making a GUI with Tkinter
- Writing classes and functions
- Checking user input and giving feedback
## How to Play
1. Run the file: `python guess_number_game.py`  
2. Type a number between 1 and 100  
3. Click "Submit Guess"  
4. You have 5 attempts plus 1 extra for each win  
5. Click "Restart Game" to play again
